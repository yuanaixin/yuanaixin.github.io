I am a PhD student from School of Culture, Languages and Linguistics at the University of Auckland. I currently work with my supervisor Jason Brown and Karen Huang on High Vowel Fricativization in Changzhou Chinese. My research focuses on the factors from phonetic and phonological structure that induce high vowel to transition into fricative vowel.

My research interest lies in investigating speech production using approaches combining acoustic recording and ultrasound tongue imaging. 

Before I started my PhD journey, I did my postgrad at Lancaster University in the UK, under the supervision of Sam Kirkham. During that time, I did research on sociophonetics and L3 acquisition.

Apart from doing reasearch and teaching, I have
a passion for learning language, creating arts and outdooring. I've been a curious person and always eager to explore new interests.
