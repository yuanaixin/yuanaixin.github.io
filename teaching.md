# Graduate Teaching Assistant

I currently teach at [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in courses:

* **2024** Sem 2 [CHINESE 101 Beginning Modern Chinese 2](https://www.artsfaculty.auckland.ac.nz/courses/?Subject=CHINESE&Number=101&Year=2024)
* **2024** Sem 1 [CHINESE 200 Intermediate Modern Chinese 1](https://www.artsfaculty.auckland.ac.nz/courses/?Subject=CHINESE&Number=200&Year=2024)
* **2023** Sem 2 [CHINESE 101 Beginning Modern Chinese 2](https://www.artsfaculty.auckland.ac.nz/courses/?Subject=CHINESE&Number=101&Year=2024)
* **2023** Sem 2 [CHINESE 201 Intermediate Modern Chinese 2](https://www.artsfaculty.auckland.ac.nz/courses/?Subject=CHINESE&Number=201&Year=2024)

I was also an English language tutor at [New Oriental Education & Technology Group](https://www.neworiental.org/english/) from 2020 to 2022, tutoring IELTS listening, speaking, reading and writing.

I am always passionate about teaching. I enjoy putting myself in the students' shoes and considering what teaching methods are best suited for them. I love to use various teaching techniques in the classroom, such as games (e.g. [blooket](https://www.blooket.com/)), hands-on activities, role-playing, teamwork, brainstorming (e.g. [padlet](https://padlet.com/)).
