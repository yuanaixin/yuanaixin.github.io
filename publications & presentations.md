# Current projects

The research projects I'm currently working on are as follows:

* Tone-induced fricativization of Changzhou Chinese (PhD thesis)
* Additional language acquisition by bilingual (Mandarin Chinese & Changzhou Chinese) and monolingual (Mandarin Chinese) speakers

  <small>Abstract: This study focuses on the interaction of tonal register and the fricativization of vowels. High Vowel Fricativization (HVF) [1] is a model for the emergence of fricative vowels, which requires vowels to have consistent turbulence to generate a wall noise source as the driving force. However, the empirical foundation of the model remains unclear. To investigate this, 40 native speakers of Changzhou Chinese produced a series of CV monosyllabic words with alveolar fricative vowel /ʑ̩/ and its plain counterpart, the high front vowel /i/, as the nucleus across tones. We measured the spectrograms, Zero-crossing Rate (ZCR), Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR) and several phonation measurements for each token. Results indicate that the high vowel in the lower register exhibits breathy phonation and its HNR/ZCR values are similar to fricative vowels. This suggests that lower register /i/ is produced with audible turbulence, acting as one of the prerequisites for fricativization. Listeners may misperceive the vowel as a new sound category primarily cued by frication noise, eventually spreading the sound to other tonal categories and giving rise to a fricative vowel /ʑ̩/. Overall, this study provides the phonetic foundation for the emergence of frication noise in fricative vowels, arguing that register can be a motivation for change in the fricativization of high vowels.</small>
